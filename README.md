# Dictionary
A Prototype of  Dictionary -  Developed using Tkinter,  the standard GUI library for Python, which provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both “Voice Search “ and “Text Search” are active in this prototype.  The word to be searched is accepted either as audio or as text and search it in  JSON file.  The out put obtained will be displayed in textual form and the text to speach functionality will be activated simultaenously.  

New versions of this prototype are still under development and ultimate aim is to develop a reliable, easily accessible full fledged dictionary, which can be used easily even for visually imapaired too.
